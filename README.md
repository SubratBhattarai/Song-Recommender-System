# Song-Recommender-System
The song recommendation system is used to give similar alternative songs which uses analysis of the artist, producers, writers, and title.
This system gives a list of 20 songs and provides the message error when the song is missing. I can’t say the exact accuracy of the machine, but when I listen to the songs advised by the machine, I get the feeling that those are similar.

This project was only possible by “500 Greatest Songs of All Time” dataset from Kaggle and YouTube channel named Siddardhan.
